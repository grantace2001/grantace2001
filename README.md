- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I'm new to programming, trying to teach myself. I am not smart, I'm just interested in developing and interested in the tech industry. I'm teaching myself so I can develop the ideas I have. I'm not interested in making software/mobile apps/web apps for money, but that would be a plus if I'm successful. If you contact me and want to work with me on something, I'm totally down, just don't expect me to know a lot lol. lmao
